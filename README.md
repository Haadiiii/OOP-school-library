# OOP School Library

In this project I need a tool to help me record what books are in the universitie's library and who borrows them. The app that I will create will allow me to:

    Add new students or teachers.
    Add new books.
    Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Terminal
- IRB
- Robocop (linters)

## Live Demo (if available)

[Live Demo Link]() (Project will have none)


## Getting Started

`git@github.com:Haadiiii/OOP-school-library.git`
